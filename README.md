AngularJS based Quiz Application

### Need of the System
In our proposed system, we have chosen the topics of ‘Mammals’, ‘Marine Life’, ‘Birds’ and
‘Reptiles. 

Our system not only provides information, but also a follow-up quiz to test the user’s
knowledge based on the information provided. We also have a video of the corresponding topic. For
instance, on the main page, a video featuring all life forms of our system is played. Also, if you select
‘Mammals’, a short video of some selected mammals will play. 

After you complete the quiz, it will
immediately display your result. In case of a wrong answer, it will also display the correct option for that
question.

It can be said that our system has ease of use. You can watch the video, read and learn the
information, and then immediately test your knowledge by taking the quiz.

### Overview of the Project

First on the main page, a short video of around 20 seconds will play. This video
will showcase the different types of life forms we have chosen in our system. After this, on scrolling
down, you can choose from the following four modules:
1. Mammals
2. Birds
3. Marine Life
4. Reptiles

Each module contains information about 6-8 animals based on that category. A picture
will be provided along with a brief information about that species. After reading all the information, you
can proceed to take the quiz.

The quiz contains of 10 questions. We need to answer all the questions to proceed further.
Result will be shown immediately after. In case we answered a particular question wrong, the correct
answer will be highlighted. At the end of the page, we have a panel of some random facts.
